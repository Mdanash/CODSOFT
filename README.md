## Introduction
This repository contains the internship tasks assigned by CodSoft. Each task is implemented in a separate directory with its own set of instructions and requirements. This README provides an overview of the repository structure and instructions on how to set up and run the tasks.

## Tasks Overview
### Task 1: [Movie Genre Classification]
- **Objective:** This project is part of my internship at CodSoft, where I tackled the challenge of classifying movie genres using machine learning techniques. The objective of this task was to develop a model capable of accurately predicting the genre of a movie based on various features such as plot summary.
- **Directory:** `[TASKS/Task_1(Movie_Genre_Classification)]`
### Task 2: [Creditcard Fraud Detection]
- **Objective:** This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning algorithms. We experiment with Logistic Regression and Decision Trees to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate,This project is part of my internship at CodSoft.
- **Directory:** `[TASKS/Task_2(CREDIT_CARD_FRAUD_DETECTION)]`
### Task 3: [Customer Churn Prediction]
- **Objective:** This Project aims to building a model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service or business. The model uses historical customer data, including features like usage behavior and customer demographics. The code explores different machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting to predict churn.,This project is part of my internship at CodSoft.
